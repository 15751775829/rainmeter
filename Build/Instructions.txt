Building
--------------------------

Note: If you already have any paid version of Visual Studio 2010 installed (e.g. Professional, Premium, Ultimate, etc.), simply open Rainmeter.sln to build (and skip the instructions below).

* To build Rainmeter and C++ plugins, install the following tools in the listed order:
	1. Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
	2. Visual Studio 2010 SP1 (yes, this is for Visual C++ 2010 as well)
	3. Windows 7.1 SDK
	4. KB2519277 compiler update
	5. Open RainmeterCPP.sln to build.

* To build Rainmeter, C/C++ plugins, and C# plugins, install the following tools in the listed order:
	1. Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition
	2. Visual C# 2010 Express Edition
	3. Visual Studio 2010 SP1 (yes, this is for Visual C++/C# 2010 as well)
	4. Windows 7.1 SDK
	5. KB2519277 compiler update
	6. Open Rainmeter.sln to build.

* To build only C# plugins, install the following tools in the listed order:
	7. Visual C# 2010 Express Edition
	8. Visual Studio 2010 SP1 (yes, this is for Visual C++/C# 2010 as well)
	9. Open RainmeterCS.sln to build.


Building installer
--------------------------

To build the full Rainmeter distribution, run Build.bat. If you receive "not found" errors, open Build.bat and change the variables at the top to match your system.

To sign the installer and the Rainmeter executables, create a Certificate.bat file alongside Build.bat with the following contents:

	set CERTFILE=/path/to/PFXcert.p12
	set CERTKEY=certpassword


Building old versions
--------------------------

The Rainmeter GitHub repository does not contain the full source code history required to build the installer for versions prior to r1249. To obtain the full source from r1 to r1248, use the old Google Code SVN repository located at:

	http://rainmeter.googlecode.com/svn

The build instructions above are applicable to r1130 - r1248. Build instructions for r27 - r1129 can be found in svn/wiki/.

The language files for r963 - r1214 were in a separate repository (svn:externals), which is not available any longer. As a result, the language .dll's for those revisions cannot be built.
